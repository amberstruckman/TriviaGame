# TriviaGame

This game takes responses from the user via radio buttons and after a 60 second timer scores the quiz.  There can only be one answer per question and blank responses will be considered an incorrect response.  The quiz can be scored sooner than the 60 second timer by pressing a submit button at the bottom of the page. 

The theme for this quiz is the United Nations.
